# SpaceX Launch Prediction Capstone

This project is the final capstone for the Coursera course **Data Science Tools** by IBM.
The goal is to explore, analyze, visualize, and model SpaceX Falcon 9 launch data to predict successful landings.

## 📁 Project Structure
- `EDA.ipynb`: Exploratory Data Analysis of the launch dataset.
- `SQL_Analysis.ipynb`: SQL queries and analysis using Jupyter with `%sql` magic.
- `Folium_Map.ipynb`: Interactive map showing launch sites using Folium.
- `Modeling.ipynb`: Predictive modeling using classification (Logistic Regression).
- `dash_app.py`: Interactive dashboard built using Plotly Dash.
- `Capstone_Presentation.pptx`: Final presentation summarizing the project.
- `screenshots/`: Folder with images used in the final presentation.

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Plotly, Folium)
- SQL (with ipython-sql)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- GitHub
- PowerPoint / Google Slides

## 🚀 Objective
To build a predictive model that estimates whether a SpaceX Falcon 9 launch will land successfully.
